# Jelani McCurdy - Cybersecurity-Portfolio
Hi, I'm Jelani McCurdy - an emerging cybersecurity professional currently enrolled in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program via Coursera. I am currently preparing for CompTIA Security+. I'm building a hands-on experience through labs,simulations,and personal projects that demonstrate my understanding of threat detection, log analysis, and system hardening.
I'm especially interested in network security, incident response, and protecting digital systems from real-world attacks. My long-term goal is to work as a Security Analyst, helping organizations stay one step ahead of evolving threats.
This portfolio is a growing collection of my projects, notes, and research as I progress deeper into the field
